# Book Search Engine

## Description

This project was created because I wanted to create a book search engine using graphql.
What this does is it uses graphql to make queries and mutations on the database to add users, login users, save and remove books.
What I learned from project was how to use graphql to make queries and mutations and how to use apollo server to connect the backend to the front end.
